In our github repository you will find three files excluding this. 
The first one is called "2016_StockDirection_RF.ipynb" which is where we implemented our code to attempt to get a better accuracy than the researchers who wrote the paper.
The second file is "AAPL.csv" which is the dataset that we worked with and used to implement our code. 
The last file is "RandomForestAlgoo.ipynb" which is where we made our initial comments when we tried running the researchers code to understand it.
